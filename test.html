<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">9.2 With the exception of section 9.4, payment terms are 14 days from the invoice date, and any exception from these terms requires written consent from an authorised representative of the Carrier.

The value of the total amount payable by the Customer for the Booking (including additional costs) will be released from the pre-authorized funds to the Carrier after completion or cancellation of the Booking. The customer hereby authorises the carrier to charge any remaining balance to the customer's credit card if the pre-authorized funds on the customer's card are not enough to cover the full amount the customer owes to the carrier. To be clear, a pre-authorization is a security assurance, and until the pre-authorization is released, no money is taken from the customer's account. Only the value of the Consignment plus any additional fees (if any) incurred in accordance with section 3.4 will be charged to the Customer's credit card.</span>



<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">9.5 The Carrier reserves the right to raise fees upon 30 days' written notice to account for fuel price changes.

After the date on which the changes take effect, the Customer is free to decide whether or not to make any additional Bookings. Any change to the tariff will not affect the rate that was in place when a reservation was made prior to the change.</span>



<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">9.6 Until full payment is received, Carrier is allowed to charge interest  on the outstanding balance at a rate of 4% over the Bank of England base rate as needed. When a payment is not made by the due date, the customer is responsible for covering all costs and/or expenses incurred by the carrier in attempting to collect the outstanding balance, including reasonable attorney fees and collection costs.</span>



<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">9.7Any questions about an invoice must be submitted in writing within 7 days of the invoice's date, or the invoice will be deemed accepted and the Customer will be charged in full.</span>



<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">9.8 Value added tax and any other duties or taxes that may occasionally become due or payable are not included in the prices stated or charged; instead, they must be included to invoices at the rate in effect on the date of the invoice.</span>



<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">9.9 A method for computerised invoicing is used by the Carrier. The Customer will get all invoices, credit notes, and statements online.

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">10.1 In order for the Carrier to legally process any Personal Data (including delivery and contact information) provided by the Customer to the Carrier and to exercise its rights and fulfil its obligations with respect to Bookings, the Customer must give all notices and obtain all consents necessary.</span>
